## DA3 Assignment 2
**Finding fast growing firms 2025**\
In pairs, please indicate here.

### The assignment

Your task is to build a model to predict fast growth of firms using the bisnode-firms data we used in class.

- You should design the target (fast growth), it can be measured in any way you like over one (2013 vs 2012) or two years (2014 vs 2012).
- You need to argue for your choice, discussing a few alternatives, maybe 2-3 paragraphs using concepts and ideas from corporate finance.
- Build three different models and pick the one you like the most.
- Should include at least one logit and one random forest.

### Data management, sample design
- The dataset is very close to what you saw in seminar.
- But you need to start with the panel for 2010-2015.
- Two pieces of code, sample design and prediction:
    - `ch17-firm-exit-data-prep`
      - Starts from cs_bisnode_panel.csv
      - Yields bisnode_firms_clean.csv
    - `ch17-predicting-firm-exit`
  - On the sample, you can make changes, but do not need to.

### Features
- You may use similar variables and features we used for exit prediction.
- You may do differently.
- Look at descriptives, lowess, tabulate factors, make decisions.

### Tasks 1
#### PART I: Probability prediction
- Predict probabilities.
- Look at cross-validated performance and pick your favorite model.
#### PART II: Classification
- Think about the business problem, and define your loss function (like FP=X dollars, FN=Y dollars).
- For each model:
  - Predict probabilities.
  - Look for the optimal classification threshold.
  - Calculate expected loss with your loss function.
  - Pick the model that has the smallest average (over 5 folds) expected loss.
#### PART III: Discussion of results
- Show a confusion table (on a selected fold or holdout set).
- Discuss results, evaluate how useful your model may be.
### Tasks 2
- There are two industry categories in the dataset: manufacturing and services (repair, accommodation, food).
- Define a single loss function, but carry out the exercise for two groups separately.
- Pick a prediction model, carry out classification for manufacturing and then repeat for services.
- Compare the model performance across two samples.
#### Submit two documents to moodle
1. A summary report (pdf), max 5 pages including tables and graphs discussing your work.
   - It is targeted to data science team leaders and senior managers.
   - Can use technical language but explain briefly
   - But need to be the point!
   - Focus on key decision points, results, interpretation, decision.
2. Technical report – in pdf with more technical discussion.
   - May include code snippets (not verbose, avoid iterations, etc.).
   - May include additional tables and graphs.
   - Detail all decisions you made.
   - Reports should link to code in GitHub.

| Discussion of steps, decisions and results                           | 15%    |
| Explain shortly every modeling decision                              | —      |
| Final discussion of findings (2–3 paragraphs)                        | —      |
| Quality of the write-up, prettiness of graphs, etc.                  | 15%    |

#### AI use
- You may use AI for any part of the exercise.
- But you are responsible for all submitted work.
- In return, we expect nice and clean code, reproducibility, pretty graphs, and well-written summary texts.
